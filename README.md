## Project Files

Our analysis is split across several Jupyter notebooks:

- `CS226_Big_Data_Project.ipynb`: Primary analysis notebook containing success factor visualization and rating distribution analysis
- `cs226_project_pj4.ipynb`: Implementation of geographical visualization for various business categories including restaurants, medical services, and shopping
- `LocationBasedInsights.ipynb`: Analysis of business distribution across cities and states, including top city rankings and state-wise rating comparisons
- `SuccessFactors_BigData_Project.ipynb`: Comprehensive analysis of business categories and statistical table generation for performance metrics

Each notebook should be run independently and requires the same setup steps described in the Setup Instructions section.
